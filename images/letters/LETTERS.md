# Letters

This folder contains gifs for all 26 letters of the alphabet. Numbers and symbols will probably be added later.

The letter files cannot be distributed on GitHub due to licening reasons, so you'll have to use your own.

## Naming

The letters are not case-sensitive. All filenames are simply `letter.gif`, where `letter` is the lowercase letter of the alphabet contained in the gif.
