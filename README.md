# flaps-chelton

### A very, very, VERY over-engineered Discord bot built with JavaScript, then rebuilt with TypeScript.

## Features:

-   Many FFmpeg-based commands
-   Many Canvas-based commands
-   !stablediffusion command
-   Web interface
-   So, so much more.

## .env instructions:

-   To get the PLAYGROUND_COOKIE variable:

1. Go to https://playgroundai.com/ and log in with your Google account.
2. Search through the Network tab in browser DevTools to find the cookie sent along with all generation requests.
3. Copy the cookie and place it in the .env file.

-   To get the OPENAI_TOKEN variable:

1. Create an OpenAI account on https://platform.openai.com/.
2. Navigate to the API keys section in the account settings.
3. Create an API key and copy it into the .env file. _It should start with `sk-`._

-   The DISCORD_TOKEN is your Discord bot token.

Feel free to open an issue if you need anything!
